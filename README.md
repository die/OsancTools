# OsancTools
A Java application containing various tools for making security work in the Oryx Sanctuary discord server much easier.

This branch uses code created by [Xcom](https://github.com/X-com/RealmShark) in order to grab data from network packets to parse RoTMG sets. Credit for the packet code goes to him. This code, found in /java/main/packets/ and /java/main/util/, is under MIT License and will soon be put in a package to indicate this.

This code is NOT production ready, until the functionality is finalized do not expect well documented, readable, and acceptable code.
